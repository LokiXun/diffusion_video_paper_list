> In the aesthetic branch, we use **SA with size 224 × 224 during inference** and overdownsampled SA↓ size 128×128 to better exclude technical quality issues. 
>
> N = 32 frames are sampled uniformly from each video and the backbone is inflated-ConvNext [70] Tiny pre-trained with AVA [22]. In the technical branch, we crop single patches at size Sf = 32 from 7 × 7 spatial grids and sample a clip of 32 continuous frames during training, and three clips during inference
