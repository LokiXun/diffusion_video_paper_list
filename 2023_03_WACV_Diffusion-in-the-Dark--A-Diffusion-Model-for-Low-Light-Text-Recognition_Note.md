## Key-point

- Task: diffusion model for low-light image reconstruction for text recognition

- Problems

   Reconstruction methods for low-light images can produce well-lit counterparts, but typically at the cost of high-frequency details critical for downstream tasks.

  without any task-specific optimization, can outperform SOTA low-light methods in low-light text recognition on real image
