## Key-point

- Task
- Problems
  - In response, an unsupervised training technique is proposed that enables the model to extract comprehensive features from the **Fourier spectrum’s magnitude,** thereby overcoming the challenges of **reconstructing the spectrum** due to its centrosymmetric properties.

- :label: Label:

## Contributions

-  By leveraging the spectral domain and dynamically combining it with spatial domain information, we create a robust multimodal detector that demonstrates superior generalization capabilities in identifying challenging synthetic images generated by the latest image synthesis techniques.

- we present FFiT, a framework that utilizes large vision models to extract spectral domain information for detecting fake images.
